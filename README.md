I'm a Software Engineer at [Quorum Cyber](https://www.quorumcyber.com/). I have an MEng in Computer Science from the University of York, graduating with First Class Honours with Distinction. During my degree, I gained valuable experience through a placement year as a Software Engineer Intern at [Thales Underwater Systems](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/activities/defence/naval-forces/underwater-warfare#overview), where I worked on cutting-edge defence technology projects.

## 👩‍💻 What I Do
- **Software Development:** Working as a full-stack developer, with back-end experience in TypeScript, Node.js, and the Azure ecosystem. I am also [AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/2c00aea1-6422-4b2d-b36c-fccb08e0f0e4/public_url) and [GitHub Copilot](https://www.credly.com/badges/0d5ea71f-d864-4759-aa63-43748e60167a/public_url) certified! My front-end experience consists of using React and Tailwind (as well as classic HTML/CSS) with testing in Jest, Vitest, and end-to-end testing on Playwright. 
- **Other Experience:** I have also worked with Java and .NET, and am proficient in Python through my university coursework, personal projects, and challenges like Advent of Code.
- **Writing & Contributions:** I've recently began contributing to tech articles, check out my [article](https://medium.com/the-tech-collective/mastering-git-bisect-how-to-easily-track-down-bugs-in-your-codebase-25b8e05e8af5) on `git-bisect`, written as part of the [Tech Collective](https://medium.com/the-tech-collective).

## ❤️ What I'm Passionate About
- **Learning New Technologies:** I’m always eager to expand my skills and try new things!
- **Hobbies:** When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me playing video games like CS:GO 🎮 (which I even got to write my dissertation on - [check it out here](https://github.com/LucyIvatt/csgo-smoke-analysis-tool)), cheering for Arsenal WFC ⚽️, or lifting weights at the gym 💪.
- **Coffee Lover:** Always fuelled by coffee! ☕
