# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucy, a 5th year Computer Science student from the University of York. I recently completed a placement year at [Thales Underwater Systems](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/activities/defence/naval-forces/underwater-warfare#overview) as a software engineer, where I mostly created and modified user interfaces.
